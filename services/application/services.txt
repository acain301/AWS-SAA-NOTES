Load Balancers:

    Creates single entry point into application and routes request to different servers.
    capable of spanning across multiple subnets.


    Target Group, a group of servers the LB should forward request to. Target groups figure out which server to forward a request to.
    Health checks from load balancers.
    Public and private load balancers
    cross-zone load balancing, can send traffic to instances in other AZ's
    ALB and NLB
    NLB, layer 4, faster because it only forwards on port #
    ALB, layer 7, feature rich, can forward on a myriad of options and redirect


API Gateway:


AppFlow:
    Fully managed service that allows you to transfer data between various AWS resources/tools. 
    Connector, username, passwords and ect to create flow (channel) between source and destination.
    Trigger, dictates how a flow runs.
    use case, appflow connection to transfer salesforce data into Redshift. Flows transferring slack data to s3.

SNS:
    Topic, comms channel that subscribers can be added to.
    Standard and FIFO topics.
    Standard, may not show up in order and duplication may exist.
    Use FIFO if you need order and dedupe functionality. 10mb/sec, 300 messages per sec
    FIFO cannot scale as well as standard.
    Batch to save cost.
    Each message can only contain 2GB per message 
    integrates with KMS to encrypt messages.
    Can capture fan-out events from over 60 AWS services. 
    
SQS:
    Message decoupling, async processing, scalable architecture. 

Amazon MQ:
    Message broker service
    ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ fork!
    message queuing decoupling, reliable message delivery, message durability and persistence, high message throughput.

EventBridge:
    event bus, pipes, scheduler
    decoupling, scalability, processing a large scale of events, event routing and filtering.
