***** EBS *****

EC2 instance and volume have to be in the same AZ

Volume snapshots help in copying data from an AZ to another

Copy snapshot into an S3 bucket of the desired region and then create a volume from the snapshot in the new region.

General SSD balance performance and price

Provisioned IOPS SSD critical, IOPS intensive throughput-intensive workloads

***** Instance Store *****

Temporary block level storage that remains on the physical host

so if an instance is moved to a different physical host the data will be wiped because it would be on a new host

A reboot does not move the instance to a different physical host

Stopping the instance, for a couple minutes, then restarting the instance will move it to a new physical host. 


***** EFS *****

Create a mount target in an AZ in order for instances to mount and access.

Mount target becomes an ip addr

only available for linux

supports NFS v4 protocol

Can be mounted but cannot be booted


***** FSx *****

High performance file storage, wide range of workloads

other OS's can use

Managed service, AWS is responsible for prisioning file servers and managing volumes/replicating data/pathcing file server/ addressing hardware issues/manual backups

SMB protocol, Server Message Block, windows default while nfs is linux default ... can integrate with MS Active Directory


FSx Lustre is the only that is single AZ
